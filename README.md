# free-data-engineering-course-for-beginners
Learn the basics of data engineering!

This mini-course for beginners covers the entire ETL process based on Spotify API data. 

We are going to build a simple data pipeline (or in other words, a data feed) that downloads Spotify data
on what songs we've listened to in the last 24 hours, and saves that data in a SQLite database.

We will schedule this pipeline to run daily. After a few months we will end up with our own, private Spotify played tracks history dataset!
